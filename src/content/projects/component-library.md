# Component Library

A comprehensive design system and component library built for modern React applications. This project focuses on creating reusable, accessible, and well-documented components that can be easily integrated into any React project.

## Project Goals

The main goal is to create a robust component library that serves as a foundation for rapid application development while maintaining consistent design standards and accessibility compliance.

## Key Features

- **📦 50+ Components** - Comprehensive set of UI components
- **🎨 Theme System** - Support for dark/light themes and custom branding
- **♿ Accessibility First** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components
- **📖 Storybook Documentation** - Interactive component documentation
- **🧪 Full Test Coverage** - Jest and React Testing Library
- **📱 Mobile Optimized** - Touch-friendly responsive components

## Component Categories

### Form Components
- Input fields with validation
- Select dropdowns with search
- Checkbox and radio groups
- Date and time pickers

### Navigation
- Responsive navigation bars
- Breadcrumb components
- Pagination controls
- Tab systems

### Data Display
- Tables with sorting and filtering
- Card layouts

## Development Approach

The library follows atomic design principles, building from basic atoms up to complex organisms. Each component is developed with TypeScript for type safety and includes comprehensive prop documentation.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing  
- **Visual Tests** - Screenshot comparison testing
- **Accessibility Tests** - Automated a11y testing
