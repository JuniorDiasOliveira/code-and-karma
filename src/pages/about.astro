          Hi, I'm <span class="text-primary font-semibold"
            >Junior Dias de Oliveira</span
          > and honestly I never know exactly how to kick off these introductions.
          I've been working as a front end engineer for quite a few years now, always
          trying to balance two things I really enjoy: fresh modern tech and building
          experiences that actually feel good for people using them.
        </p>

        <p>
          My path has taken me through some interesting places. I spent a period
          at <span class="text-secondary">Cloudflare</span> where I got to work with
          large scaled projects, the kind of thing that feels intimidating at first,
          but ends up changing the way you understand the web at its core. Later
          on I took on the role of Front end Technology Lead at <span
            class="text-primary">Metyis</span
          > guiding teams breaking down complex problems and finding solutions that
          were equal parts practical and thoughtful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time I've grown deeply connected to the front end ecosystem. <span
            class="text-accent">React</span
          > and <span class="text-primary">TypeScript</span> have basically become
          second nature to me, and tools like Next.js, Vite, Tailwind, and Styled
          Components are part of my daily rhythm. Sometimes I step into the back
          end world with Node.js when a project needs it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog is my way of sharing a bit of what I've learned and in a way
          making sense of my own thoughts. I write about upcoming front end
          trends, architecture patterns I've tried out in real projects, and the
          tools and techniques that make modern web development not just
          effective but genuinely enjoyable (yeah, you can find some things
          quite WOOOW).
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding you'll probably find me exploring
          <span class="text-secondary">music production</span>,
          spending time with my <span class="text-secondary">cats</span> or researching
          about <span class="text-primary">hinduism</span>.
