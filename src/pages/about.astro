        <p>
          Hi, I'm <span class="text-primary font-semibold">Junior Dias de Oliveira</span>, a passionate
          front-end engineer with extensive experience building scalable web applications using modern
          technologies. My journey in software development has taken me through various roles at innovative
          companies, where I've consistently focused on creating exceptional user experiences and leading
          technical initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working at <span class="text-secondary">Cloudflare</span>,
          where I contributed to global-scale infrastructure solutions, and later at <span class="text-primary">Metyis</span>
          as a Lead of Technology for Front-end, where I guided teams in delivering complex digital solutions.
          My expertise spans across the entire front-end ecosystem, with deep knowledge in 
          <span class="text-accent">React</span>, <span class="text-primary">TypeScript</span>, and modern
          development practices.
        </p>

            Technical Expertise
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-4 text-foreground/80">
            My technical toolkit includes modern JavaScript frameworks, with particular strength in React ecosystem
            and TypeScript development. I'm passionate about creating maintainable, performant applications using
            cutting-edge tools like Next.js, Vite, and advanced CSS solutions including Tailwind CSS and Styled Components.
          </p>
          <p class="text-foreground/80">
            Beyond frontend development, I have experience with Node.js for full-stack solutions, testing frameworks
            like Jest and Testing Library, and modern development workflows using tools like Webpack, Docker, and various
            CI/CD platforms. I believe in the power of well-architected design systems and component libraries to
            scale development across teams.

          This blog represents my commitment to sharing knowledge and insights from years of building web applications.
          Here, I explore the latest trends in front-end development, share architectural patterns that I've found
          effective in production environments, and dive deep into the tools and techniques that make modern web
          development both powerful and enjoyable.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm constantly researching emerging technologies and contributing to the developer
          community. I believe that the best software is built by teams that prioritize both technical excellence
          and user-centered design, and I strive to bring that philosophy to everything I create.
        </p>
